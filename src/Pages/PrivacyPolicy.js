                Provide voice, image and camera services. When you use our

                Comply with legal obligations. In certain cases, we collect and
                use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance,

                learn more, please read our Interest-Based Ads notice.
                <br />
                Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks. We use personal information
                to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the
                security of our customers, SuperShop, and others. We may also
                use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks.
                <br />
                What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?
                <br />
                To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to

                <br />
                Does SuperShop Share Your Personal Information?
                <br />
                Information about our customers is an important part of our
                business and we are not in the business of selling our
                customers’ personal information to others. We share customers’
                personal information only as described below and with
                SuperShop.com, Inc. and subsidiaries that SuperShop.com, Inc.
                controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or
                follow practices at least as protective as those described in
                this Privacy Notice.
                <br />
                Transactions involving Third Parties: We make available to you
                services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
                parties for use on or through SuperShop Services. For example,
                the products you order through our marketplace are from third
                parties, you can download applications from third-party
                application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party
                skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or
                sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as
                sellers on the marketplace, restaurants registered on
                SuperShop.in, merchants providing mobile recharges and
                bill-payment assistance. You can tell when a third party is
                involved in your transactions, and we share customers’ personal
                information related to those transactions with that third party.
                <br />
                Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and
                individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
                fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
                sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information
                from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing
                assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
                listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content,
                scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing
                customer service. These third-party service providers have
                access to personal information needed to perform their
                functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they
                must process the personal information in accordance with
                applicable law.
                <br />
                Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we
                might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
                transactions, customer information generally is one of the
                transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises
                made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the
                customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that
                SuperShop.com, Inc. or SuperShop Seller Services Private Limited
                or any of its affiliates, or substantially all of their assets
                are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the
                transferred assets.
                <br />
                Protection of SuperShop and Others: We release account and other
                personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
                comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and
                other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
                SuperShop, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
                information with other companies and organizations for fraud
                protection and credit risk reduction.
                <br />
                Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when
                personal information about you might be shared with third
                parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share
                the information.
                <br />
                How Secure Is Information About Me?
                <br />
                We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.
                <br />
                We work to protect the security of your personal information
                during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.
                <br />
                We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI
                DSS) when handling payment card data.
                <br />
                We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in
                connection with the collection, storage, processing, and
                disclosure of personal customer information. Our security
                procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of
                identity before we disclose personal information to you.
                <br />
                Our devices offer security features to protect them against
                unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these
                features and configure them based on your needs.{" "}

                What About Advertising?
                <br />
                Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: SuperShop
                Services may include third-party advertising and links to other
                websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect
                information about you when you interact with their content,
                advertising, and services. For more information about
                third-party advertising at SuperShop, including interest-based
                ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads policy. To adjust your
                advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising
                Preferences page.
                <br />
                Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: We provide ad companies
                with information that allows them to serve you with more useful
                and relevant SuperShop ads and to measure their effectiveness.
                We never share your name or other information that directly
                identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising
                identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived
                from applying irreversible cryptography to other information
                like an email address. For example, if you have already
                downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising
                identifier and data about that event so that you will not be
                served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also
                use this information to serve you relevant ads from other
                advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of
                interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising
                Preferences page.
                <br />
                What Information Can I Access?
                <br />
                You can access your information, including your name, address,
                payment options, profile information, Prime membership,
                household settings, and purchase history in the "Your Account"
                section of the website or mobile application.{" "}

                that you can access. To request access to personal information

                What Choices Do I Have?
                <br />
                If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your
                personal information, please contact our Grievance Officer. Many
                of our SuperShop Services also include settings that provide you
                with options as to how your information is being used
                <br />
                As described above, you can always choose not to provide certain
                information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of
                many of the SuperShop Services.
                <br />
                You can add or update certain information on pages such as those
                referenced in What Information Can I Access?. When you update
                information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our
                records
                <br />
                If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications
                from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.
                If you don’t want to receive in-app notifications from us,
                please adjust your notification settings in the app or device
                <br />

                Advertising Preferences.

                devices also provide users with the ability to change device
