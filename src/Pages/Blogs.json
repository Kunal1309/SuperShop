        "description":"Press is an ecommerce store that sells various plant-based juices, soups, and cleanse kits.A major part of its ecommerce site is its blog, which has its own dedicated landing page and name:The Squeeze.Press uses its blog to educate visitors about leading a healthy lifestyle and how its juices and soups provide an array of health benefits. Blog posts are educational and informative and are used as a direct way to help customers make a more informed purchase decision. The Squeeze blog is all about building trust in the Press brand and positioning Press as industry leaders. Our Favorite Feature: The design and layout of The Squeeze blog is simple, and Press cleverly uses hero images that mirror the colors of the juices and soups to help create a strong sense of brand identity and cohesion.",

        "description":"EPZ Fun sells plates, utensils, and other eating and drinking equipment aimed at toddlers and young children.The ecommerce store is vibrant and contains a large volume of different products to help make mealtimes fun for children and stress-free for parents. The products that EPZ Fun sell are supported by the on-site blog that features blog posts on an array of relevant topics including weaning tips, first food ideas, and recipes. Whilst the ecommerce store is obviously targeted at parents, the on-site blog helps to reinforce this by positioning the EPZ Fun brand as a one-stop-shop for parents looking for both tips and advice and practical products. The EPZ Fun blog is categorized into various topics including recipes, eating challenges, mealtime milestones, and feeding tips helping visitors to easily find the content that’s right for them. Our Favorite Feature: The EPZ Fun blog posts directly link back to the products they sell and almost all posts use imagery to showcase the products available to purchase on the ecommerce site in action.

        "description":"Au Lit Fine Linens sells literally everything you could possibly need to get a good night’s sleep, from pillows and duvets to luxury sheets. This ecommerce brand has been around for a while so it’s no surprise that it’s pretty experienced when it comes to offering an exceptional web experience. Aside from the products, the ecommerce website also features an on-site blog that has its own name and brand identity. “Between the Sheets” cleverly plays on the products offered on the ecommerce store as well as giving the content on the blog an exclusive feel. The imagery and design of the blog create a relaxed and calming vibe thanks to the use of neutral and light blue colors, mirroring the overall website theme of sleep. Our Favorite Feature: Almost all of the blog posts focus on a problem a visitor may have, with the solution being one of Au Lit Fine Linens products. This is a clever way of directing blog readers back to the ecommerce section of the website. ",

        "description":"Supernatural Kitchen sells natural alternatives to all of our favorite baking ingredients such as frosting, chocolate chips, and food coloring. This ecommerce website is bursting with examples of baked goods (enter at your own risk if you’re hungry!) and the on-site blog is used to support the overall ecommerce strategy. The blog is simple and rather than being positioned as a blog, is listed as a recipes page instead. Here you’ll find – you guessed it – various recipes that you can make using Supernatural Kitchen products. By keeping the blog simple and purely focusing on recipes, Supernatural Kitchen ensures it doesn’t take any focus away from what its products can do.Our Favorite Feature: All of the recipes featured on the blog use many of the Supernatural Kitchen products, which encourages visitors to make a purchase once they’ve found a recipe they want to make. This is a practically useful tactic for directing users who have stumbled across the recipe toward Supernatural Kitchen products.",
